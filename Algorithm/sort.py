# what is sorting?
# A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements 
# according to a comparison operator on the elements.
# popular sort algorithms:
# 1- selection sort:
# sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted 
# part and putting it at the beginning.Â 
# steps to solve the problem:
# - Initialize minimum value(min_idx) to location 0.
# - Traverse the array to find the minimum element in the array.
# - While traversing if any element smaller than min_idx is found then swap both the values.
# - Then, increment min_idx to point to the next element.
# - Repeat until the array is sorted.
# 2- insertion sort:
# works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. 
# virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted
# part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
# steps to solve the problem:
# - compare the first two elements and sort them.
# - pick the third element and find its proper position among the previous 
# two sorted elements till the end.
# 3- quick sort:
# it picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the pivot. 
# we can pick pivot in different ways:
# - pick the first element.
# - pick the last element.
# - pick a random element.
# - pick median.
# 4- merge sort:
# dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then 
# merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.
# 5- bubble sort:
# repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
# it is not suitable for large data sets.

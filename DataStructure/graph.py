# what is graph?
# a non-linear data structure consisting of a set of objects where some pairs of 
# objects are connected by links, objects are represented as vertices or nodes and the 
# links that connect the vertices are called edges. 
# there are two ways to store a graph:
# 1- Adjacency Matrix
# store the graph in the 2D matrix where rows and columns denote vertices. each 
# entry in the matrix represents the weight of the edge between those vertices.
# 2- Adjacency List
# there is an array of pointer which points to the edges connected to that vertex.
# 3- dictionary
# in python and other languages which have dictionary data structure can use it.
# usage of graphs:
# - maps can be represented using graphs and then can be used by computers to 
# provide various services like the shortest path between two cities.
# - when various tasks depend on each other then this situation can be represented 
# using a Directed Acyclic graph and we can find the order in which tasks can be 
# performed using topological sort.
# - state transition diagram represents what can be the legal moves from current 
# states.

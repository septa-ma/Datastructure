# what is hash table?
# it's a key-value data structure (maps keys to values).
# you can find your key or value immediately that the search and insertion function. 
# of a data is constant time -> O(1) and linner time for a terriable time -> O(n).
# you can use any types of data structure for keys or values.
# it could be a good solution for any problems.
# components of hashing:
# key -> it's an index or location for storage of an item, it can be anything -
# - string or integer which is fed as input in the hash function.
# hash function -> a function that converts a given numeric or alphanumeric key-
#Â -and do some calculation to find the exact position of the key in the memory-
# -then returns the index of an element.
# collision -> whenever two keys have the same hash value.
# seprate chaining -> a way for handling collision make a Linked List at each- 
# -index which containing all keys for a given index.
